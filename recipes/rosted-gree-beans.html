    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse green beans and pat dry with paper towels; spread onto a rimmed
        baking sheet. Drizzle beans with olive oil, then season with salt and
        pepper. Use your hands to toss the beans until evenly coated with oil;
        spread out in a single layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven until beans are crisp-tender, look slightly
        shriveled, and start to show golden caramelized spots, 15 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
